                <h3>Blooming Sunflower!</h3>
                <p>Sunflowers are bright, yellow, tall flowers that come to life in the summer. The flower blooms in mid summer to
                    early autumn in North America. The closest Sunflower fields to New York City are in Long island and New 
                    Jersey. When you take the drive there remember to bring a camera and take lots of pictures!
